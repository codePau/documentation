Users of the platform (*Participants*) interact in *Participatory Spaces* through mechanisms known as *Components*. 

*Participatory Spaces* and *Components* can be developed, activated and deactivated independently.
Decidim architecture is modular, scalable, easy to configure and integrate with other tools or apps (data analysis, maps, SMS, mail, social networks, etc.).

The *Home Page* of the platform is fully customizable: it can display different types of banners, call-to-action buttons, it can also display statistics and interactive visualizations, activity streams, and maps with the upcoming meetings.

Decidim displays *Participatory Spaces* on the top menu (dark). *Components* are displayed on the bottom menu (white).
