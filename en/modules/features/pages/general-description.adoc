._Decidim Interface._

The *Home Page* of Decidim is fully customizable: it can display different types of banners, call-to-action buttons, it can also display statistics and interactive visualizations, activity streams, and maps with the upcoming meetings.

Users of the platform (*Participants*) interact in *Participatory Spaces* through mechanisms known as *Components*. 

Decidim displays *Participatory Spaces* on the top menu (dark). *Components* are displayed on the bottom menu (white).

._Decidim Functional Architecture._

Decidim architecture is modular, scalable, easy to configure and integrate with other tools or apps (data analysis, maps, SMS, mail, social networks, etc.). *Participatory Spaces* and *Components* can be developed, activated and deactivated independently.


*Administrators*

There are different types of administrators in Decidim: 

* *administrators* of the whole platform or of specific spaces and components

* *moderators*, with the exclusive power of moderating proposals, comments or debates

* *collaborators*, who can read unpublished content, create notes and responses to proposals
